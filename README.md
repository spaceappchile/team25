To commemorate Earth Day, we integrated different solutions -speech recognition, voice synthesizing and a new technology to plot maps into MS Excel- to provide a new experience of data visualization, based on a virtual earth model which displays the evolution of pollution levels (PM10) over time. 

We used Kinect technology to develop a software that allows natural user interaction along with the visualization. This permits the use of gestures and voice commands to navigate the model and see the changes in pollution arround the world.
